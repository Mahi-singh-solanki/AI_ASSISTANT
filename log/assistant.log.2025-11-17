[2025-11-17 10:26:09] [INFO] [Thread-5 (processor)] — Answered the query result- Stored the information Elon Reeve Musk = "South African-born American entrepreneur, businessman, and engineer known for his leadership roles in several high-profile technology companies."

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He holds citizenship in South Africa, Canada, and the United States, having obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother and becoming a U.S. citizen in 2002.

Musk earned bachelor's degrees in physics and economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997. He co-founded Zip2, an online city guide software company, which was sold to Compaq in 1999 for $307 million. Later, he co-founded X.com, an online payment company that merged with Confinity to become PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002.

Using the proceeds from these ventures, Musk funded his next major projects. In 2002, he founded SpaceX, a space technology company, serving as its CEO and chief engineer, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars.

In addition to SpaceX, Musk joined Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors), an electric vehicle and clean energy company, in 2004, initially as chairman and product architect, becoming CEO in 2008. Under his leadership, Tesla developed the Roadster, Model S, Model X, and Model 3, and expanded into solar energy products and battery storage.

Musk is also the founder and CEO of The Boring Company, which aims to reduce urban traffic through underground tunnel networks, and co-founded Neuralink in 2016 to develop brain-machine interface technology. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research organization, to promote safe and beneficial AI.

In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter, a major social media platform, and rebranded it as X in July 2023. He has been the wealthiest person in the world since 2021, with an estimated net worth of around $500 billion as of October 2025 according to Forbes.

Musk served as the Commissioner of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during the second administration of U.S. President Donald Trump from 2022 to 2025, stepping down in May 2025. He has been married twice and is the father of at least 14 children.

Musk is known for his public statements on technology, artificial intelligence, space exploration, and politics, which have drawn both acclaim and controversy.

[2025-11-17 20:53:18] [INFO] [Thread-5 (processor)] — Answered the query result- Quantum Mechanics is a fundamental physical theory that explains the behavior of matter and light at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical physics fails to provide accurate predictions. It describes phenomena like wave-particle duality, superposition, quantum entanglement, and quantum tunneling. Despite its success in making precise predictions, the interpretation of what it reveals about reality remains a subject of debate among physicists and philosophers.

They capture semantic, syntactic, or contextual relationships to enable machine learning models to process real-world data more effectively. They are learned automatically from data through algorithms like neural networks and are used in various tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
