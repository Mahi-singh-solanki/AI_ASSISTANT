[2025-11-07 15:32:40] [INFO] [Thread-5 (processor)] — Answered the query result- Agatha Christie was a mystery writer who published works like 'Murder on the Orient Express' and 'The Mystery of the Blue Train.' Her favorite book is 'Good Girls Guide to Murder.' She can also be considered a queen of all publishing genres as she is one of the top-selling authors in history, with her combined works selling more than 2 billion copies worldwide. Christie was born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller on September 15, 1890, in Torquay, Devon, in the southwest part of England. She was a Royal Flying Corps pilot during World War I and published her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1920; the story focused on the murder of a rich heiress and introduced readers to one of Christie's most famous characters, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. She dealt with tumultuous personal life events, such as her famous disappearance in 1926, which lasted for eleven days. Christie is often referred to as the "Queen of Crime" and the "Queen of Mystery."
